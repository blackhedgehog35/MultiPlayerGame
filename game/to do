SETTINGS/MENU:
[ ] Make a general function which will allow us to put error pop-ups, for example when the values are not
 correct for the keys in settings.py, for the moment it just doesn't save but will have to be explained to the user
 why didn't it save. Do this function for when the server is not responding because the host and/or port
 is not valid, it will be necessary to indicate this to the user by a pop-up (currently I have put a print() but it is not
 ideal)
[ ] Small problem in WaitingRoom because when I leave the window, I cannot delete the thread therefore the thread
 still runs after the window is deleted, which is probably problematic if I want to create another object
 ClientNetwork, this would mean that there are several requests sent. For the moment it does not bother because the variables
 are just forgotten but I'm afraid there are problems at the query level, because I don't know how it works, but in
 In any case it is not clean.
