# MultiPlayerGame

**Open World Multiplayer Game Project**

This project aims to create a 2D multiplayer video game with a top-down view set in a fantastic open world. It is divided into two parts: the server and the game itself. To run the game on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Download the code from this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Launch the `server-main.py` script.
4. Then, launch the `game-main.py` script.

We have incorporated graphical assets available for free on itch.io to enhance the game's aesthetic:

- [Fantasy Skeleton Army](https://blpixelartist.itch.io/fantasyskeletonarmy) by blpixelartist
- [Pixelarium Grasslands](https://lukepolice.itch.io/pixelariumgrasslands) by lukepolice
- [Tiny RPG Character Asset Pack](https://zerie.itch.io/tiny-rpg-character-asset-pack) by zerie

This project is a collaboration between @MaxDkn and @blackhedgehog35 on Github. Its development began on May 29, 2024, and is still ongoing. Stay tuned for updates and enhancements!
